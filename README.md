# Bike Sharing Analysis & Proposal
<!-- Tableau proposal for a Des Moines bike share business (Rice Bootcamp) -->
## Project Overview
Bike sharing programs have become increasingly popular across the nation[^1][^2][^3][^4].  Des Moines, Iowa, has the fastest-growing major Midwest metro[^5], and has been actively working to revitalize older areas and bring new forms of entertainment[^6].  A bike sharing business should be highly successful in the current environment.  

To support investor evaluation of the bike share viability in Des Moines, this analysis looks into the highly-successful CitiBike bike-sharing program in New York City to better understand some key business factors:
1. Who uses bike sharing programs?
2. Where in a city are bike shares predominantly used?
3. When are bike shares most and least frequently used?
4. How much are individual bikes used?
